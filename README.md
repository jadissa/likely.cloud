## Purpose
1. Staying fresh by keeping up to date with industry standard libraries and development stack for RESTful content 
driven applications.
2. The first use-case for this project is to allow real-time temporary and or permanent storage of text, images, video 
or audio files, their display accross supported devices, a means to follow contributors, the ability to upvote or 
downvote, comment on or repurpose to 3rd parties.
3. A second use-case might be to allow contributors to share locations using GIS for a specific purpose. Checkins are a 
foreseeable outcome.
4. The technology stack, aims and goals of this project should be ever-evolving, consistent with the ever-changing 
standards and technologies of web based computing.
5. It should act as an alternative to other social media that has certain content restrictions such as the rquirement
for "real names".
