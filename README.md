inconclusive

###### Contributed Q/A for Devs
I feel like there should be a short quiz at the end of the profile page to ensure that a person has read and understood the entire profile. Only after successfully passing the quiz can they send a message. This would solve SO many problems IMO.

You get out what you put in. In other words, you only see users who have invested as much time as you. This encourages community and involvement.

Building a profile is hard for some users. Automatically help build for them.
